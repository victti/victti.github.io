                    I'm a fairly young programmer excited to get into the games industry professionally. I've been using my few projects as a preview into the field by reversing many games, including some AAA titles, first to see how they work from a technical point of view, and second to see what can be expanded and improved upon.
                    <br><br>
                    I love innovative ideas and optimization, that's why I always come back to old pieces of code I did and rewrite them to see if I can make them have better quality and/or performance. Quality has always been one of my top priorities.
